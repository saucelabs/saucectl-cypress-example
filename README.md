# saucectl cypress example

Example running saucectl with cypress.

**Note**: If all you want is to publish your cypress test results to Sauce Labs (but not run on Sauce Labs), please check out our [cypress reporting plugin](https://github.com/saucelabs/sauce-cypress-plugin)!

## What You'll Need

The steps below illustrate one of the quickest ways to get set up. If you'd like a more in-depth guide, please check out
our [documentation](https://docs.saucelabs.com/testrunner-toolkit/installation).

### Install `saucectl`

```shell
npm install -g saucectl
```

### Set Your Sauce Labs Credentials

saucectl configure
```

## Running The Examples

Simply check out this repo and run the command below :rocket:

3 test suites are being triggered in `docker` and `sauce` mode. `saucectl` will run the suites marked as `docker` mode firstly and then run the suites which are marked as `sauce` mode.

```bash
saucectl run
```
